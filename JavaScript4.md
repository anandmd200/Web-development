## What is Document Object Model (DOM)

The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for manipulating HTML documents.

The DOM represents an HTML document as a tree of nodes. The DOM provides functions that allow you to add, remove, and modify parts of the document effectively.

```js
<html>
  <head>
    <title>JavaScript DOM</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello DOM!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
